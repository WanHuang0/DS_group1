# Milestone 2
## Task 2

### 3. - How would you explain a Docker container and volume to a child?
Docker is a way to package application with all the necessay dependencies and configuration.
It is a portable artifact, easily shared and moved around. 
Docker volumes are file systems mounted on Docker containers to preserve data generated by the running container. 

To put it another way, imagine I build a house with all furnitures. 
One day I decide to travel around the world. I use a magical camera to take a photo of the house brfore I leave and put it in my backpack. 
Whenever I arrive at a new place, I just use this magical photo make a copy of house which I can directly move in.
I collect some materials along the journey and make handicrafts with the tools stored in the house. There is a problem with the house. Every time when I walk out of the house, 
the handicrafts will disappear. So I have to pack these stuff into my backpack and carry them with me. 
When I return to the house, I take out the stuff from my backpack and continue to make handicrafts.

### 4. - What is your preference concerning the use of Python virtualenv and Docker? When would you use one or the other?
**Python virtualenv**  
Python virtualenv allows users to switch between different versions and dependencies.
It is used to isolate projects. They also contain a reference to the python executable that should be used within the environment.
Normal use-cases include project isolation for local development and multiple independent Python projects on production.

**Docker**  
Docker encapsulates the application layer of operating system. It is used to isolate entire applications. 
It’s common to launch multiple Docker containers for different components of an application and communicating them over transfer channels.
Normal use-cases include shipping and running applications on production. 

The pros of using virtualenv over Docker include its ease of use (clean and simple interface), fast creation/activation of environments, 
lightweight environments and better developer experience for simple projects (for example IDE support).
In addition, Docker is a much more complex technology with limited support on Windows and MacOS.

The con of using virtualenv over Docker is that it’s support is limited to Python. By only using virtualenv, 
you have no guarantees that external dependencies in another system will play nicely with your code.
In comparison with virtualenv, Docker provides control over external dependencies, better reproducibility in different host systems, 
better control over all the components of an application (not just Python) and their interactions, reuse of common architectures (there are many Docker images online ready for use).

## Task 6 Dockerize code
Steps:
1. Download and install Docker Desktop on windows 11
2. Open Docker Desktop, go to the settings and enable integration with defaut WSL distribution Ubuntu-22.04
3. Open Ubuntu terminal, go to the group project repository
4. Create a Dockfile, which installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
5. Use command `docker build . -t python_cnn` to create a new image named python_cnn
6. Inspect docker images via command `docker images`
7. Use `docker run python_cnn` to create a container and run the `main.py`
