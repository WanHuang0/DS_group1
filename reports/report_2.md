Task 4

 A docker build context is the set of files located in the specified PATH or URL. The context and dockerfile are used to build docker images from.

Task 5 

The Python Package Index can be useful for assessing the quality of a given python package. Factors to include in the evaluation of a given package are:
1) Number of stars on GitHub
2) License of the project
3) is the use compliant with the licence?
4) Does the package has its own GitHub repository or homepage?
5) The quality of the README.md file
6) Popularity on Stack Overflow
7) The date of the last commit
8) Do the bugtracker exist?


Modules for python script:

We  have decided to split the python code into 4 modules:
1) Data preparation and scaling the image
2) Building the model
3) Training the model
4) Evaluating the trained model

Above split seems to be the only one sufficient for this code 
as it contains the intuitive division into parts that are
needed for any project with trained models.
