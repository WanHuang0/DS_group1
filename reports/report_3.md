What is PostgreSQL?

- PostgreSQL is an open source object-relational database system that supports both SQL (relational)
  and JSON (non-relational) querying
- SQL is the language used to interact PostgreSQL, (like with many others Relational database
  management system), so it is an SQL, but 
  PostgreSQL has added support for JSON (which has been the most popular format for semi-structured data stored in NO-SQL systems)
