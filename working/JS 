TASK 1 

The MNIST data-set is used for image processing systems and it contains of handwritten digits. It is a dataset used for machine learning. 
a) the data base represents the classification (not regression) problem. 
b) 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, the imaages are in 28x28 pixels format.

TASK 4 

I have tried running the code on PyCHarm 2020.3.3. In order to even tried running it, I had to delete the comment and the beggining of the code (which is odd - comments should not be harmful) but I have encountered an issue. I have updated the operating system and the PyCHarm's default interactive shell is now zsh. Even with those changes, my environment still shows me bin... I had to switch the shell from bin to z
sh. Wan's local machine read the code without an issue and Siergiey's PyCharm (the same version) is announcing that he has to dowload libraries in order to run the code.
