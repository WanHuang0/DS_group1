# Milestone 1
## task 1 
Explain the data set

1. The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. 
It solves the classification problems. Specifically, it is used to classify a given image of handwritten digit into one of 10 classes 
representing integer value from 0 to 9.
2. MNIST consists of 70,000 handwritten images of digits (60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 in the test set). The images are
28x28 pixel grayscale. All images are labeled with the respective digit that they represent. There are a total of 10 classes of digits (from 0 to 9).

## task 4
Explain how to run the code

1. 
2. python version 3.8, packages tensorflow and numpy are required.
3.
